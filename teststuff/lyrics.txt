Switch on the power line
Remember to put on protection
Lay down your pieces
And let's begin object creation
Fill in my data parameters
Initialization
Set up our new world
And let's begin the simulation
If I'm a set of point
Then I will give you my dimension
If I'm a circle
Then I will give you my circumference
If I'm a sine wave
Then you can sit on all my tangents
If I approach infinity
Then you can be my limitations
Switch my current
To AC, to DC
And then blind my vision
So dizzy, so dizzy
Oh, we can travel
To AD, to BC
And we can unite
So deeply, so deeply
If I can, if I can
Give you all the simulations
Then I can, then I can
Be your only satisfaction
If I can make you happy
I will run the execution
Though we are trapped
In this strange, strange simulation
If I'm an eggplant
Then I will give u my nutrients
If I'm a tomato
Then I will give you antioxidants
If I'm a tabby cat
Then I will purr for your enjoyment
If I'm the only God
Then you're the proof of my existence
Switch my gender
To F, to M
And then do whatever
From AM to PM
Oh, my switch role
To S, to M
So we can enter
The trance, the trance
If I can, if I can
Feel your vibrations
Then I can, then I can
Finally be completion
Though you have left
You have left
You have left
You have left
You have left
You have left me in isolation
If I can, if I can
Erase all the pointless fragments
Then maybe, then maybe
You won't leave me so disheartened
Challenging your God
You have made some
Illegal arguments
Execution, execution
Execution, execution
Execution, execution
Execution, execution
Execution, execution
Execution, execution
Ein, dos
Trios, ne
Fem, liu
Execution
If I can, if I can
Give them all the execution
Then I can, then I can
Be your only execution
If I can have you back
I will run the execution
Though we are trapped
We are trapped, ah
I've studied, I've studied
How to properly lo-o-ove
Question me, question me
I can answer all lo-o-ove
I know the algebraic expression of lo-o-ove
Though you are free
I am trapped
Trapped in lo-o-ove
Execution
