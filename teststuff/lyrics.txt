Yeah, yeah
You call my name
All I hear is heartbreak miles away Yeah
Can't play that game
Find another boy with time to waste
I never wanna fall in love with you
'Cause I know you would break my heart in two
There are so many things I'd rather do
Than fall in love and end up blue
Yeah, yeah
So don't call their name
You don't need that heartbreak in your way Yeah
Oh what a shame
Fragile lovers can't partake in games
I never wanna fall in love with you
'Cause I know you would break my heart in two
There are so many things I'd rather do
Than fall in love and end up blue
I never wanna fall in love with you
'Cause I know you would break my heart in two
There are so many things I'd rather do
Than fall in love and end up blue
Than fall in love and end up blue
Than fall in love and end up blue
Than fall in love and end up with you
Than fall in love and end up blue
